**Cinema Management System**

A console-based Cinema Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project is designed to manage cinema-related records such as movies, screenings, and customer bookings in an organized and efficient way.

📌 Project Overview

The Cinema Management System provides a structured solution for handling cinema operations.
It allows users to perform basic management operations including adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting movie and screening records, as well as managing customer bookings.

This project focuses on applying OOP principles to model real-world entities and demonstrates how management systems are built using Java/C++ fundamentals (depending on your language).
