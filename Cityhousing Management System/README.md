**City Housing Management System**

A console-based City Housing Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project is designed to manage housing-related records such as houses, residents, and related details in an organized and efficient way.

📌 Project Overview

The City Housing Management System provides a structured solution for handling housing data within a city.
It allows users to perform basic management operations including adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting housing records.

This project focuses on applying OOP principles to model real-world entities and demonstrates how management systems are built using Java/C++ fundamentals (depending on your language).
