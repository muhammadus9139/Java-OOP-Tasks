🃏 Card Game

A console-based Card Game project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
This project simulates a standard deck of cards and allows operations like shuffling, dealing, and playing simple card games using Card, Suit, and Rank classes.

📌 Project Overview

The Card Game project models a standard deck of 52 playing cards using OOP principles:

Card: Represents a single playing card combining a suit and rank.

Suit: Defines the four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).

Rank: Defines the thirteen ranks (Ace through King).

The system allows you to manage a deck, shuffle cards, deal hands, and perform card-related operations for games like Poker, War, or simple drawing games.

✨ Features

🎴 Create a full deck of 52 cards

🔀 Shuffle the deck randomly

🃏 Deal cards to players

📄 Display card information (Suit + Rank)

🧩 Modular design using separate Card, Suit, and Rank classes

🧠 Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)

Encapsulation and Data Abstraction

Arrays / Lists to store the deck
